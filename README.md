# CSN Token - Enterprise-Grade Solana Token Launchpad

**This project emphasizes secure data handling and controlled access, with clear documentation for reliability

**A production-ready token launchpad that prevents rug pulls and ensures fair distribution.** Built on Solana's Token-2022 standard with enterprise security features including anti-sniping protection, time-locked minting, and automated vesting controls. Every aspect prioritizes security and transparent data handling‚Äîfrom PDA-based state management to comprehensive audit trails. This isn't just another token contract; it's a complete launch infrastructure that protects both founders and investors.

**Try it now:** `git clone https://github.com/SirNeilRob/csn-token.git && cd csn-token && ./setup.sh`

## ‚ú® Features

- **Fixed Supply**: Maximum of 100,000,000 CSN tokens
- **Time-Locked Minting**: Restricted to once per year
- **Authority Control**: Only designated mint authority can mint
- **Token-2022 Support**: Uses the latest SPL token standard
- **Secure State Management**: PDA-based state storage
- **Burn Functionality**: Token holders can burn their own tokens
- **Professional Frontend**: React app with Phantom wallet integration
- **Comprehensive Security**: Anti-sniping, cooldowns, emergency pause

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Smart Contract Components

- **State Management**: PDA-based state account storing mint authority and timestamps
- **Minting Logic**: Controlled minting with supply cap and time-lock enforcement
- **Burning Logic**: Self-service token burning for holders
- **Security**: Authority checks and supply validation

### Token Distribution (Planned)

- **Staking Rewards**: 40% (40,000,000 CSN)
- **Treasury**: 15% (15,000,000 CSN)
- **Initial DEX Offering**: 14% (14,000,000 CSN)
- **Liquidity Pools**: 4% (4,000,000 CSN)
- **Marketing**: 7% (7,000,000 CSN)

## üìã Smart Contract Functions

### `initialize`
- Creates the state PDA
- Sets the mint authority
- Initializes timestamps and counters

### `mint_csn`
- Mints new CSN tokens (authority only)
- Enforces supply cap (100M maximum)
- Enforces time-lock (once per year)
- Updates state timestamps

### `burn_csn`
- Burns tokens from holder's account
- No special restrictions

## üîí Security Features

- **Supply Cap Enforcement**: Prevents minting beyond 100M tokens
- **Time-Lock Mechanism**: Restricts minting frequency
- **Authority Validation**: Only authorized parties can mint
- **PDA State**: Secure state management using Program Derived Addresses
