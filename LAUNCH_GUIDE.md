## üöÄ Launch Sequence

### Phase 1: Pre-Launch Setup (24 hours before)

```bash
# 1. Deploy to mainnet
anchor deploy --provider.cluster mainnet

# 2. Initialize token with security measures
anchor run initialize --mint-authority <MULTISIG_ADDRESS> --unique-seed <TIMESTAMP>

# 3. Distribute initial allocations
anchor run distribute --unique-seed <TIMESTAMP>

# 4. Lock liquidity (prevent rug pulls)
anchor run lock-liquidity --unique-seed <TIMESTAMP> --lock-amount <LP_TOKENS>
```

### Phase 2: Launch Activation (T-0)

```bash
# 1. Activate launch phase with security measures
anchor run activate-launch-phase --unique-seed <TIMESTAMP>

# 2. Create liquidity pool
# - Add $10,000 initial liquidity
# - 50% USDC/SOL + 50% CSN equivalent
# - Set initial price ratio
```

### Phase 3: Trading Begins (T+30 seconds)

- **Anti-sniping protection active** (30 seconds)
- **Buy cooldown enforced** (30 seconds between buys)
- **Max wallet limit active** (1% max per wallet)
- **Vesting vaults locked** (1 year minimum)

### Phase 4: Post-Launch (T+24 hours)

```bash
# 1. Finalize token authorities (make immutable)
anchor run finalize --unique-seed <TIMESTAMP>

# 2. Register token in lists
# - Jupiter Token List
# - Raydium Token List
# - CoinGecko (if eligible)
```

## üîí Security Measures Explained
